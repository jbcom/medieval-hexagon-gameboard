## Problem

A river runs through your board. At runtime a quest objective dams the river upstream; downstream tiles need to switch from `water` to `mud` for the next 50 simulation ticks, then revert.

## Snippet

```ts
import { gameboardCommandActions } from 'declarative-hex-worlds/commands';
import { HexTileState } from 'declarative-hex-worlds/traits';

const swap = world.actions(gameboardCommandActions).plan({
  kind: 'inject-tile',
  tileKey: '4,2',
  patch: { terrain: 'mud' },
});
world.actions(gameboardCommandActions).execute(swap);

// Later, revert.
world.actions(gameboardCommandActions).execute({
  ...swap,
  patch: { terrain: 'water' },
});
```

## What the library handles

- **Trait mutation under koota's transaction model.** Tile state changes are observable by queries.
- **Re-validation.** Connectivity rules re-run; downstream placements that depended on `water` neighbors may flag warnings.
- **Snapshot stability.** Post-mutation `runtime.snapshot()` reflects the new state; deterministic replay from the same script reproduces the same sequence.
