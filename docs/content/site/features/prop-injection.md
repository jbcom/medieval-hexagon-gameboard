## Problem

A merchant arrives at the tavern tile with three crates of trade goods. You want the crates rendered on the tile, queryable by AI, and removable when the merchant leaves.

## Snippet

```ts
import { spawnGameboardPlacement } from 'declarative-hex-worlds/koota';

const crateA = spawnGameboardPlacement(world, {
  tileKey: '2,4',
  assetId: 'crate_A_big',
  kind: 'prop',
  layer: 'prop',
  metadata: { ownerActorId: 'merchant:trader-7' },
});
```

## What the library handles

- **Placement spawn.** Adds the koota entity with `IsGameboardPlacement` + `PlacementOnTile` + `PlacementState` traits.
- **Footprint check.** Asserts the prop fits within the tile's available footprint slots.
- **Query surface.** Consumer can later `findGameboardActor(world, ...)` to locate the merchant + iterate their placements.
