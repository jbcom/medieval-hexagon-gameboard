/**
 * Resolve the workspace root (the directory containing `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)

 * (`packages/declarative-hex-worlds/`), so a fixed number of `..` hops is
 * brittle — this walks up until it finds the workspace marker instead.
 *
 * Package-level artifacts (README/NOTICE/LICENSE, `src/`, `assets/`,
 * `package.json`) stay resolved relative to the package root and must NOT use
 * this helper.
