 * SimpleRPG board — the declarative render surface (RFC 0001 RFC0-2).

 * The first real consumer of `declarative-hex-worlds/react-elements`: it renders
 * the SimpleRPG runtime through the declarative `<HexWorld>` + `<GameboardObjects>`
 * surface, inside a consumer-owned R3F `<Canvas>` (per the Canvas-ownership design
 * — the game owns the Canvas/camera/lights; dhw owns the board composition + render
 * bridge). This is what proves the element layer works as a real game's board, and
 * feeds documentation screenshots and visual-verification showcases.
