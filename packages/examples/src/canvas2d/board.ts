 * The canvas-2D binding example — renders the SHARED example game in 2D

 * This is the 2D counterpart to `../three/board.tsx`: it takes the SAME game
 * (`../game`) and draws it through `declarative-hex-worlds/canvas2d` onto a 2D
 * canvas context, using a tileset source to resolve each placement to a sprite
 * cell. Proving the same game renders through a second, non-three binding is the
 * whole point of the examples package — apples-to-apples, and each binding gets a
 * real render example the documentation can demonstrate.
